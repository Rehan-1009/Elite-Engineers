# Free Resource Hub for Engineering Aspirants

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive, multi-page static website designed to serve as a free resource hub for engineering students. The core mission is to empower the next generation of engineers by providing an accessible library of resources, including university syllabi, previous year questions (PYQs), and reference books.

The website demonstrates a solid understanding of frontend development fundamentals and is intended to be a stepping stone for future backend integration.

## Key Features
- **Multi-page Structure:** Includes a Homepage, Registration page, Login page, and Resources dashboard.
- **Form Validation:** All registration fields use HTML5 validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Resource Organization:** The resources page uses tables and lists to organize syllabi and books by branch and year.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout is designed to be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices (using CSS).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** For the core structure and content of the website.
- **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** (Under development) For handling interactivity and future backend communication.
